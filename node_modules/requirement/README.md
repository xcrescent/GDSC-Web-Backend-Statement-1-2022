# Requirement

## Install

```bash
npm install requirement --save
```

## Why index

Generating index files allows you to do a `require` on any directory and get back an object representing the directory structure.

For big projects, this allows you to require dependencies in a more concise way.

### Example

`cms/index.coffee`:

```coffee
# Generated by `gulp index`.
#
module.exports =
  Editor:
    Article: require "./editor/cms.editor.article"
    Header: require "./editor/cms.editor.header"
  Header: require "./header/cms.header"
  Modals:
    Cropper: require "./modals/cms.modals.cropper"
    Embed: require "./modals/cms.modals.embed"
    Media: require "./modals/cms.modals.media"
    Headers:
      Publish: require "./modals/headers/cms.modals.headers.publish"
      Strip: require "./modals/headers/cms.modals.headers.strip"
```

Now requiring becomes easy:

```coffee
{ Editor, Header } = require "./cms"
```

Indexing with explicit requires also keeps your project compliant with Browserify compilation.

## Build indices

This gulp task generates an `index.coffee` file in a directory and its subdirectories.

```coffee
gulp = require "gulp"
Task = require("requirement").Task

gulp.task "index", ->
  paths = [
    "#{__dirname}/../../app/scripts"
    "#{__dirname}/../../app2/components"
  ]
  new Task { paths }
```
